Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making.
AI is broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks like image recognition or language translation, and General AI, which can mimic human intelligence across various domains.
This article will explain the key concepts of AI, its applications across industries, and its impact on modern society.
Recent advancements in AI have led to breakthroughs in natural language processing, deep learning, and automation, transforming fields such as healthcare, finance, and robotics.
AI-powered tools like chatbots, virtual assistants, and predictive analytics are now widely used, improving efficiency and decision-making processes.
